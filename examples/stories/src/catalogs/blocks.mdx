# Overview

`@component-controls/blocks` is a library of context-sensitive components to display specific bits of information
about the pages, documents, components and stories in your documentation site.

- There are thre main categories of components:
  - that display information about a page/document.
  - that display story data (i.e. story source, story render)
  - that display component(s) data (i.e. prop tables, component sources)
- Many of the block components should have a 'plain' and a 'block' version, where the block version adds a collapsible box with a title.
- Some components accept a list of custom ActionItems to be extended.
- Components that deal with source code (story or component source) display actions to browse their respective repositories.

import { Playground } from '@component-controls/blocks';
import { ComponentCard, Catalog } from '@component-controls/addon-catalog';
import componentCatalogImg from './media/components-catalog.jpg';

export const filter = ({ doc, component }) =>
  component && doc.title.startsWith('Components');

## Introducing addon-catalog

Fresh off the oven, the [addon-catalog](https://github.com/ccontrols/component-controls/tree/master/plugins/addon-catalog) is meant to collect and display a grid-like list of component cards.

You can include the new component catalogs in your [MDX](https://component-controls.com/tutorial/esmodules-stories) documentation files, along with other general information about your components library.

## Live example

For a quick preview, you can check this [live example](/api/components-index) of our library of [theme-ui](https://theme-ui.com) based components:

## Installation

The `addon-catalog` is not installed by default when using `component-controls`, and you will need to add it to your project

```
yarn add @component-controls/addon-catalog
```

## Catalog usage

```mdx:title=Components/index.mdx
import { Catalog } from '@component-controls/addon-catalog';

# Components

<Catalog
  filter={({ doc }) => doc.title.startsWith('Components')} <!-- filter which components to display -->
  group={({ story }) => story.category} <!-- grouping of the filtered components by the category field of the document  -->
/>
```

The `<Catalog />` component comes with search and filter features and allows for custom grouping of the selected components:

<Catalog
  filter={({ doc }) => {
    const titleParts = doc.title.split('/');
    return ['BlockContainer', 'Popover', 'GithubAvatar', 'Tag'].includes(
      titleParts[titleParts.length - 1],
    );
  }}
  group={({ story }) => story.category}
/>

## Single Card

You can also include single component cards in your documentation by specifying the story-id to use. Each card displays some component statistics -

- component name and description
- component package name and version
- preview rendered component
- dates created and last committed
- commits on component's file
- component's contributors
- number of lines, todos and comments

<Playground>
  <ComponentCard id="components-githubavatarlist--overview" />
</Playground>

Enjoy and let us know what you think!

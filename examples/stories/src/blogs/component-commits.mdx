# Introducing Commits and Stats

There are many advantages that come from using [stories](/tutorial/esmodules-stories), or live examples, in your
component development process. Some of them are:

- You're forced to write components in isolation (considered
  good practice and is necessary for your components to be displayed as stories)
- You're given a platform to display your components in all their different states.
  This makes sharing your components with teammates or designers easier.
- Additional data is automaticaly extracted from your components and displayed in the story,
  creating a cohesive story of what your component does, its status, and its development history.

One of the ways component-controls differentiates itself from other story-creating libraries is
in the amount of data we extract from a component, thus creating a more detailed story of
it.<br /><br />

Our most recent update adds two additional sections to the story page, each containing additional
data about the component:

1. First, a small section at the top of the story displays some "stats" about the component such
   as the number of source lines, comment coverage, and number of TODOs.
2. Second, we've added a `Commits` table, showing the [git](https://git-scm.com) commit history of the component.

[Here](/api/esm-starter--overview) is an example story, where you can see now these two new sections.
Additionally, we've added examples of these two sections below.

_Keep in mind these stats are specific to the component file, NOT the story file where you document that component._

## Component Stats

<Playground openTab="none">
  <ComponentStats component={store.components['Control']} />
</Playground>

This stats section is found on the top right of a story. It shows:

1. The number of source code lines (i.e. non-comment/empty lines) in the component's file
2. The comment coverage for that file (calculated as **# comment lines / # code lines**)
3. The number of "TODOs" in the file, if any
4. The number of passed tests for the current component
5. The number of failed tests for the current component
6. The percent of test coverage for the current component

When analyzing the component source, while the number of source-lines and comment coverage are nice to know, having the number of TODOs
gives developers a deeper understanding of their components' statuses.

## Component Commits

<ComponentCommits id="esm-starter--overview" title="Commits" />

This `Commits` section contains a table where:

- Each row is a git commit
- The columns are the commit date, commit author, and the commit message

One helpful thing about knowing those who's worked on a component, when they worked on it, and
what they did, is that the time it takes for you to find who you should ask your component-related
questions to is reduced.

By the way, the commit icon, <GitCommitIcon />, at the end of each commit message links
to that exact commit on Github. Try clicking one of the <GitCommitIcon />'s in the table above to
view that commit on Github.<br /><br />

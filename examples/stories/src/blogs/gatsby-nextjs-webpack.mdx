# Overview

`component-controls` allows using several static site generators (SSG) as well as raw webpack builds to create the production version of your documentation sites.

- [gastby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) - in many aspects, gatsby is the original static site generator for react and continues to be a leader in this space.
- [nextjs](https://nextjs.org) - for many years, nextjs was known for SSR, however recent builds allow creating highly optimized static sites.
- [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) - you can also build your site directly with webpack, which is used by both gatsby and nextjs under the hood.

In this blog post, we will research which solution offers the best development and production experience. 
For webpack, only one set of results will be displayed as webpack 4 and webpack 5 are very similar in performance - the one difference to keep in mind is that ts-node and typescript webpack configuration files add about 5-10s starting the webpack project.

## Performance Tools

The web tests are conducted with [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org) and [PageSpeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/).

# Large sites

The following measurements are for this live documentation site, which has several hundreds of pages and stories.

## Examples Source Code

The documentation sites used throughout this post are essentially the same for comparison. We would truly appreciate any feedback to additionally optimize our examples for the researched SSGs.

## Live Sites

All the sites are hosted on a free tier at [netlify](https://www.netlify.com). The tests are conducted on the same simple documentation page.

          An important, user-centric metric for measuring perceived load speed because it marks the point in the page load timeline when the page's main content has likely loaded—a fast LCP helps reassure the user that the page is useful.

> gatsby and nextjs create much faster and better-optimized sites - as expected since they use code-splitting and create separate bundles for each page. On the other hand, webpack provides a somewhat better development experience with faster builds and smaller bundle sizes.

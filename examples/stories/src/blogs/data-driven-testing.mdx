## Component driven development

[component-driven developmen (or CDD)](https://itnext.io/a-guide-to-component-driven-development-cdd-1516f65d8b55) means embracing components as the new primitive of the web, and tapping into their modular power to achieve better speed, scalability, and standardization for web application development.

For our development process, we suggest organizing each component in their own folder:

<img
  alt="component folder"
  title="component assets in their folder"
  src={componentAssetsImg}
/>

In the screenshot above, you can see a component `VariantButton.tsx` in its own folder alongside its various assets

- `VariantButton.data.ts` contains the generated data-driven testing data.
- `VariantButton.stories.tsx` contains the component documentation (or stories) file.
- `VariantButton.test.ts` contains the generated jest snapshot and accessibility tests
- the `design-assets` folder contains various assets associated with the copmponent's documentation, such as images and markdown notes.
- the `__snapshots__` folder contains the saved output of the snapshot testing.

## More testing with less effort

Adding tests for each of your components and the amount of work involved oftentimes will stop you short of achieving a high percentage of tests coverage.

In this tutorial we will show you step-by-step how to automatically generate components tests and the associated data-driven testing tables of data.

## Getting started

Create a new documentation project

[getting started with gatsby](/tutorial/getting-started/gatsby)
[getting started with nextjs](/tutorial/getting-started/nextjs)
[getting started with webpack/react-router](/tutorial/getting-started/webpack)

## Install cc-cli

## Generate tests

- choose target (cjs, esm or ts)
- choose test renderer (rtr, rtl or enzyme)
- chose level

1. store
2. document
3. story
   click example

## The tests UI

- summary at top
- test results
- test coverage

## Test errors

- introduce error
- delete snaphot
- add new story to increase coverage

## Data driven testing

- create data files
- review UI and select data
- rename data row
- randomize controls and copy paste into file

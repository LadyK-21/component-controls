# Addon stats

We just published the new jsx instrumenting feature and related cross/usage jsx components statistics for component-controls.

This unique feature allows you to view the jsx trees of your components and answer questions such as - which of my components is the most used as a building block, and which attributes of each component are most used.

# JSX Tree display

This is displayed on the documentation page of each component, where you can see a tree of jsx nodes and the attributes used in each node.

Here is a live example of our [BlockContainer](/api/components-blockcontainer--overview) component:

<Playground>
  <ComponentJSX of={BlockContainer} />
</Playground>

# Addon-stats

The addon-stats package contains several api functions, react hooks, and ui elements to make it easy to display cross-usage statistics on the components in your documentation site.

## Install

```sh
yarn add @component-controls/addon-stats --dev
```

## Usage

```mdx:title=stats-page.mdx
import {
  ComponentUsage,
  AttributeUsage,
  ComponentUsageList,
  AttributesUsageList,
} from '@component-controls/addon-stats';

## Attributes usage summary

Attributes usage - how many times an attribute is being set on a component, and on which component it is being set

<AttributeUsage />

## Components usage details

How many times a component is being used from another component, with a list of the components using it

<ComponentUsageList />

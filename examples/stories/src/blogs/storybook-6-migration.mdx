# Migration from Storybook 6

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) is an open-source tool for developing stories (aka examples) of your UI components.

When using component-controls to create stories, docs, and more, you can choose [Gatsby](/tutorial/getting-started/gatsby), [Nextjs](/tutorial/getting-started/nextjs), or Storybook's own SSG as your static site generator (SSG).

_We recommend you use either Gatsby or Nextjs as your component-controls SSG because of how much faster they are than Storybook. We do an in-depth analysis of this [here](blogs/gatsby-vs-nextjs-vs-storybook)._

Below are tutorials that'll guide you step-by-step through converting a Storybook 6 project to a component-controls project using your preferred SSG.

The sample project we'll be using for this guide is a Tailwind, Typescript, Storybook 6, and React Testing Library starter repo, and you can find it [here](https://github.com/ssengalanto/tw-sb-rtl-starter).

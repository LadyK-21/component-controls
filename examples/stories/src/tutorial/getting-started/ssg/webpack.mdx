Below, we go over how to add a `component-controls` documentation site to [new Webpack projects](#clone-starter) and [existing Webpack projects](#existing-webpack-project).

You can find sample projects

- webpack 4 [git repo](https://github.com/ccontrols/webpack-controls-starter) and a [live site](https://webpack-controls-starter.netlify.app/).
- webpack 5 [git repo](https://github.com/ccontrols/webpack-5-controls-starter) and a [live site](https://webpack-5-controls-starter.netlify.app/).

## Clone starter

The easiest way to get started is to clone the webpack-5-controls-starter project

**webpack 5:**

```sh
git clone git@github.com:ccontrols/webpack-5-controls-starter.git my-webpack-project
```

**webpack 4:**

```
git clone git@github.com:ccontrols/webpack-controls-starter.git my-webpack-project
```

You can also start your project from scratch, or using one of the webpack starter tutorials (for example [this article](https://www.carlrippon.com/creating-react-app-with-typescript-eslint-with-webpack5/))

## Existing Webpack project

### Add component-controls

```sh
yarn add @component-controls/react-router-integration
```

### Enable component-controls

You will need to make a few changes to your webpack.config.(js|ts) files:

```js:title=webpack.dev.config.js
const {
  withComponentControls,
} = require('@component-controls/react-router-integration/webpack-build');

const publicFolder = process.env.PUBLIC_PATH || 'public';
const publicPath = path.join(__dirname, publicFolder);

const config = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.tsx',
  ...
}

// the following will compile your documentation files before launching the webpack proces to compile the documentation site itself:
module.exports = withComponentControls({
  config,
  options: { configPath: '.config', distFolder: publicPath },
});
```

or if you are using ts-node and typescript webpack configuration files

```js:title=webpack.dev.config.ts
import webpack from 'webpack';
import { withComponentControls } from '@component-controls/react-router-integration/webpack-build';

const publicFolder = process.env.PUBLIC_PATH || 'public';
const publicPath = path.join(__dirname, publicFolder);

const config: webpack.Configuration = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.tsx',
  ...
}

// the following will compile your documentation files before launching the webpack proces to compile the documentation site itself:
module.exports = withComponentControls({
  config,
  options: { configPath: '.config', distFolder: publicPath },
});
```

> Be aware that react/webpack/react-router applications are single page applications (SPA), where all pages are running from the same index.html file. To address this issue of [client-side routing](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment#netlify) and depending on your server provider, you might need to use something ie [create-file-webpack](https://github.com/Appius/create-file-webpack) to create a `_redirects` file

## Create documentation site

### Create a src folder

```sh
mkdir src
```

### React index file

Create a new or edit `index.tsx` or `index.js` file in the src folder:

```jsx:title=src/index.tsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { App } from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root'),
);
```

### HTML template file

Create a new or edit `index.html` file in the src folder. PLease note that you might need to update a standard `index.html` file with the `<base href= />` tag to [account for dynamic routes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28253162/react-router-dynamic-segments-crash-when-accessed):

```html:title=src/index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <base href="/" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Application home

Create a new or edit `App.tsx` or `App.js` file in the src folder and import the `useRoutes` hook from `@component-controls/react-router-integration`.
This will return a list of all the routes and corresponding pages for the documentation site that you can include in your `<Router>` component, alongside any other custom routes as needed.

```jsx:title=src/App.tsx
import React, { FC } from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';
import { useRoutes } from '@component-controls/react-router-integration';

export const App: FC = () => {
  const routes = useRoutes();
  return <Router>{routes}</Router>;
};
```
